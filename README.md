# Nutrapi
This is a nutrition assistant app, written on Python. The dietary values are taken from the USDA Api. The nutritional values that are tracked by the app are chosen with consultation of Dietitian Selin Enengin.
Users are prompted to type in their daily diet to the app. After they do so, their nutritional intake is calculated with the help of USDA data. 
Then the users are informed about their possible deficiencies and overdoses, regarding their daily intake.
The app is not designed to be used by pregnant, or breast-feeding women, which have different nutritional reference values. The app is designed for people over 18.
Therefore, if you are pregnant, breast-feeding or under 18, you are advised to directly contact a professional (doctor/nutritionist).
Lastly, before starting to take a dietary supplement, you are advised to see a professional.
